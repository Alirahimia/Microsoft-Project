📅 Construction Scheduling with Microsoft Project

This repository documents a construction scheduling exercise developed using Microsoft Project as part of my coursework and professional development in Construction Engineering and Management.

🧠 Project Overview

The project involved:

- Creating a detailed Gantt chart for a multi-phase construction project  
- Defining task dependencies, durations, and milestones  
- Allocating resources and analyzing the critical path  
- Applying baseline tracking and progress monitoring techniques  
- Exploring integration potential with BIM and cost estimation workflows

🔐 Data Sensitivity

Due to confidentiality concerns, the original .mpp file is not publicly shared. It contains proprietary or sensitive project data. A sanitized version may be shared upon request or during interviews.

📌 Relevance

This project reflects my practical experience in construction planning and complements my technical work in:

- BIM automation using Dynamo and Python  
- Digital Twin schema development  
- Parametric modeling and simulation for robotic workflows
